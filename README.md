# Showcase
This is sample code from my Data Structures course.

# DoublyLinkedList.py
This is a sample from a lab where I was required to implement a doubly linked list with operations including insert, deletion, addition, etc.

# MixedFraction.py
This is an object that I created for several labs. It inherits the Fraction class, not from the python standard library. I implemented class members such as numerators, denomenators, and whole numbers. The functions include rich comparison operators and overridden arithmetic operators.

# Fraction.py
This is an object that I created for labs using MixedFraction.py. The fraction class is the parent of MixedFraction and includes similar class members like numerators and denominators. It includes rich comparison operators and overridden arithetic operators.

# cStack.py

Here I implemented the stack data structure built on top of a list. I include functionallities such as peek, pop, and push.

# cQueue.py

Here I implemented the queue data structure built on top of a list. I include functionalities such as enqueue and dequeue.

# binheap.py

This is an implementation of a binary heap structure. I use this structure for building a priority queue in lab 7 to decrease the big o on ciertian operations. 

# InfixPostfix.py

In this lab, I had to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions and then further evaluate them in another file Postfixeval.py
